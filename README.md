### Overview

Welcome to the Next.js and Lingui static site generation (SSG) template project! This repository demonstrates the
state-of-the-art integration of Next.js and Lingui for creating static web apps with multi-lingual support.

Next.js, a powerful React framework, is designed to build server-rendered React applications and SSG sites. In this
context, we're utilizing Next.js's Static Site Generation capabilities to pre-render pages at build time.

Combined with Lingui, an i18n (internationalization) library for JavaScript, we've endeavored to produce a multilingual
static website that effectively caters to a global audience.

Our aim with this template project is to illustrate the procedure of building an international static web app that is
performant, SEO-advantaged, and maintains simplified translation management, courtesy of the capabilities brought about
by the coupling of Next.js's SSG and Lingui.

### Key Features

* **Static Site Generation with Next.js**: Experience the unique advantages of utilizing Next.js in our static web
  application. This includes benefits such as improved performance and SEO, client-side routing, and a more streamlined
  development process.
* **Translation Management with Lingui**: Discover how Lingui simplifies handling translations in our static web app,
  from message extraction to language pluralization and localized formatting.
* **Real-time Language Switching**: Experience an interactive feature of our static web app that enables dynamic
  language switching. This allows users to effortlessly switch between different languages without navigating away from
  their current page.
